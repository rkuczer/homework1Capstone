Hello Visitor!

This is my program that calculates the total charge required to be paid by a customer according to
their state and the item records associated with them. 

All that is needed is to run the program and then input a valid state since we only are working with 
DE, PA, and NJ these values are case sensitive since it is a state. 

There are also unit tests that accompany the program as well that can be run. 

TO RUN: Make changes to the driver code block at the bottom of main to determine what state or items in records you want to change.
Then just run main.py. To run the tests just run the file, if there is an error with the user's input then the returned value is a 0.
