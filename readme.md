Hello Visitor!

This is my program that calculates the total charge required to be paid by a customer according to
their state and the item records associated with them. 

All that is needed is to run the program and then input a valid state since we only are working with 
DE, PA, and NJ. 

There are also unit tests that accompany the program as well, user input is also needed for the test but it passes no problem.
